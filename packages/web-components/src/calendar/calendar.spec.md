# Calendar

## Component Description

The Calendar lets users view and select a single date or a range of dates*. The calendar has five different views: date, month, week, year, and range-picker*.

\*V.2 will include the range-picker feature.

### Calendar vs. Date Picker Implementation

The calendar and the date picker have significant overlap in inputs, outputs, and events. The difference is that the date picker is essentially a calendar combined with an input field, in which the input field can interact with the calendar by opening and closing the calendar and displaying/modifying the selected dates of the calendar. It is important to note that the calendar is the component that stores the selected dates, which is then exposed to the date picker.

## Design Spec

Due to the incomplete nature of the v9 calendar design spec, work on the component will be based on the calendar from the v8 api while using the skin of the calendar in the v9 date picker design spec.

- [x] What keyboard behaviors does the component support?
  - [x] Arrows - Moves focus according to the grid behavior
  - [x] Enter - Select the date
  - [x] Home - Moves focus to the first day (e.g. Sunday) of the current week

## Preparation

- [x] This component will inherit from and document the [FAST Calendar Component](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/tree/master/packages/web-components/fast-foundation/src/calendar)

- [x] [Check the Fluent UI React V9 Component Spec](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/tree/master/specs) for differences and document:

  - [Fluent UI React v8 Calendar Component Spec](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/calendar)
  - [Fluent UI React v9 Date Picker Component Spec](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/specs/Datepicker.md)

  Differences

  - The Calendar component in Fluent React v8 handles picking a range of dates differently from the v9 Date Picker component. The v9 Calendar should handle date ranges in the same way as the v9 Date Picker.
  - Fluent UI has a Close button for the calendar, but the v9 Date Picker design spec does not.

- [x] [Fluent UI React V9 Storybook](https://aka.ms/fluentui-storybook) for implementation differences and document:

  - [Fluent React V9 Date Picker](https://master--628d031b55e942004ac95df1.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/compat-components-datepicker--default)

- [x] [Component Spec authored](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Component-Implementation-Guide#component-spec)
  - [ ] And [reviewed](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Component-Implementation-Guide#spec-review)

## Implementation

- [ ] Initial conformance and unit tests (validate basic functionality)
- [ ] [Initial documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Component-Implementation-Guide#documentation)
  - [x] [Storybook stories](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Component-Implementation-Guide#storybook-stories)
